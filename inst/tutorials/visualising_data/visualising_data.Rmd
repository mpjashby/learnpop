## Introduction

Presenting data is a score part of data analysis. Not only is presenting data
key to communicating information to colleagues and partners, but presenting data
can help understand patterns and trends as part of your analysis. In this 
tutorial you will learn how to present data in R in several different ways.

```{r ggplot2-image, fig.align="center", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggplot2_masterpiece.jpg")
```



## Bar charts

*Bar charts* are useful for showing values on a continuous variable (e.g. a
count of crimes) for each value of a categorical variable (e.g. neighbourhoods 
in a city). Bar charts are very common, but there are several things we can do 
to make them more useful. In this section we will learn how to construct a good 
bar chart.

<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" title="ggplot2 website"><img src="images/ggplot2.png" class="right-side-image"></a>

To make charts in R we will use the `ggplot2` package, which is one of the 
packages that is automatically loaded when you call the function 
`library(tidyverse)`. You have already used functions from the `ggplot2`
package to make a crime map.

In this tutorial we will use data on the frequency of different types of 
violence in the different states of Malaysia in 2017. This data from the Royal
Malaysian Police is already loaded in an object called `violence`.

In a previous tutorial you learned how to print the first few rows of a dataset.
Type the code needed to do this in the code box below and click `Run Code` to 
see the results.

```{r bars-exercise1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r bars-exercise1-solution}
# To print the first few rows of a dataset, you type the name of the object
violence
```

Printing the first few rows of an object is often useful, but it has one 
drawback: if the rows at the top of the dataset aren't representative of the
data as a whole, you might miss things. A better way to look at part of a 
dataset is to look at a random sample of the data. We can do this using the
`slice_sample()` function from the `dplyr` package, which you might remember is
loaded automatically when you load the `tidyverse` package. Run this code to
print 10 random rows from the `violence` data.

```{r bars-exercise2, exercise=TRUE}
slice_sample(violence, n = 10)
```

From this, we can see that each row contains the count of a different type of
crime in a different Malaysian state. We can use this data to create a simple 
bar chart showing the number of murders in each state.

```{r bars-exercise3, exercise=TRUE}
violence %>% 
  filter(crime_type == "murder") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = state, y = count))
```

In this code, the `filter()` function removes all the rows from the dataset 
except those for which the `crime_type` column is equal to `murder`. The 
`ggplot()` function tells R that we want to create a chart and everything that
comes after that (in this case, just one more line of code) controls the 
appearance of the chart. One little quirk to notice is that whereas we usually
construct a pipeline of code using the pipe (`%>%`) operator, we instead combine
the different functions that we use to make a plot using the `+` operator. Just
remember: before `ggplot()` we use `%>%` and after `ggplot()` we use `+`. R will
warn you if you get it wrong.

By convention, each function that we add to `ggplot()` to change the appearance
of our map goes on a new line (this makes the code easier to read) and all but
the first line is indented by two spaces. RStudio does this indenting 
automatically if the previous line ends with a `+` symbol, since RStudio then
understands that there is more code to come on the next line.

In the code above, it is the function `geom_col()` that tells R that we want to
produce a bar chart rather than any other type of graphic. Later in this 
tutorial we will see examples of other functions that begin with `geom_` to
produce different types of chart. For example, if you want to add a layer to 
your chart showing a scatter plot, you use the `geom_point()` function, while if 
you want to make a line chart you use `geom_line()`.

```{r example-charts, fig.align="center", out.width="80%"}
ex_point <- tibble(x = rnorm(50, 10, 1), y = rnorm(50, 10, 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "A scatter plot using geom_point()") +
  theme_minimal()
ex_line <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = rpois(10, 5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  labs(title = "A line chart using geom_line()") +
  theme_minimal()
cowplot::plot_grid(ex_point, ex_line, align = "hv")
```

We can improve the basic bar chart we have produced in several ways:

  * We can switch the order of the variables used for the `x` (horizontal) and 
    `y` (vertical) axes so that the bars are horizontal rather than vertical, 
    which will stop the state names from overlapping. As a general rule, 
    horizontal bar charts are usually better than vertical ones.
  * We can change the axis labels, add a title and so on using the `labs()`
    function.
  * We can reduce the visual clutter in the chart using `theme_minimal()`.

```{r bars-exercise4, exercise=TRUE}
violence %>% 
  filter(crime_type == "murder") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = count, y = state)) +
  labs(
    title = "Murders in Malaysian states, 2017",
    x = "number of murders",
    y = NULL,
    caption = "Data from the Royal Malaysian Police"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can also remove the grid lines on the *y* axis (i.e. those running along the 
length of the bars) since they don't really make it any easier to understand the 
chart. As a general principle, we want to remove anything on a chart that does 
not contribute to communicating information, since unnecessary chart elements 
can distract readers from understanding the data.

We can remove the grid lines by setting the `panel.grid.major.y` and 
`panel.grid.minor.y` arguments to the `theme()` function. `theme()` controls 
lots of aspects of the appearance of charts created with `ggplot()`. To remove
the grid lines, we use the helper function `element_blank()` to set each element
of the grid lines to be blank.

```{r bars-exercise5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=17}
violence %>% 
  filter(crime_type == "murder") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = count, y = state)) +
  labs(
    title = "Murders in Malaysian states, 2017",
    x = "number of murders",
    y = NULL,
    caption = "Data from the Royal Malaysian Police"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )
```



## Showing a distribution

Bar charts show a single piece of information about each category present in a
dataset. So we might use a bar chart to show, for example, the average number of
burglaries in neighbourhoods in different districts. But what if the average
values masked substantial differences in the number of burglaries within each
district? Averages often mask variation, and can sometimes be misleading as a
result. In those circumstances it would be better to show more detail rather
than a misleading average.

Let's start with the simple example of showing the distribution of burglary
counts within a single district. The `burglary` object contains counts of
burglaries in each lower-layer super output area (LSOA) in Northamptonshire in 
England in 2020. LSOAs are small statistical areas used for analysis of local
data in the United Kingdom. To show the distribution of burglary counts within 
one district (Kettering), we can create a *dot plot* using `geom_dotplot()`.

A dot plot shows a single dot for each observation in the data (in this case,
each LSOA). The position of each dot on the horizontal (*x*) axis shows how many
burglaries occurred in that neighbourhood. The bars are then stacked on top of
each other so that they don't overlap one another. 

We will set the `binwidth` argument of the `geom_dotplot()` function to
`binwidth = 1` so that dots will only be stacked on top of each other when
neighbourhoods have the same burglary counts. We will also add some labels to
help readers interpret the chart and limit the *y* axis to focus on the data.

```{r dist-exercise1, exercise=TRUE}
burglary %>% 
  filter(district == "Kettering") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_dotplot(aes(x = count), binwidth = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of burglaries in Ketting neighbourhoods",
    subtitle = "each dot represents one LSOA",
    x = "count of burglaries, 2020",
    y = "proportion of LSOAs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see on this chart that most LSOAs had only a few burglaries in 2020 (i.e.
most dots are to the left of the chart), while a few LSOAs had a larger number
(the dots to the right of the chart). This is what we would expect, since we
know the crimes are generally concentrated in a few places.


### Plotting density curves

Dot plots can be effective at showing the distribution of a variable, but are
only really useful for a single group since they become cluttered if you try to
show several types of dot (e.g. of different colours). One way to show the
general distribution of a variable is to summarise the locations of the points
on the horizontal axis by adding a *density curve* with `geom_density()`. 

```{r dist-exercise2, exercise=TRUE}
burglary %>% 
  filter(district == "Kettering") %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_dotplot(aes(x = count), binwidth = 1) +
  geom_density(aes(x = count), colour = "red", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of burglaries in Ketting neighbourhoods",
    subtitle = "each dot represents one LSOA",
    x = "count of burglaries, 2020",
    y = "proportion of LSOAs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

In the code above, the `aes()` function that specifies which columns in the data
should be used to control the appearance of different parts of the chart is 
duplicated, once inside `geom_dotplot()` and once inside `geom_density()`. If 
all the layers in a plot use the same aesthetic specification, we can move the
call to the `aes()` function from the individual `geom_` functions to the 
`ggplot()` function that begins the stack. This helps us avoid duplication and
produces an identical chart.

```{r dist-exercise3, exercise=TRUE}
burglary %>%
  filter(district == "Kettering") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1) +
  geom_density(colour = "red", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of burglaries in Ketting neighbourhoods",
    subtitle = "each dot represents one LSOAs",
    x = "count of burglaries, 2020",
    y = "proportion of LSOAs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can use density curves to show the distribution of a variable across multiple
categories at once. For example, we could show the distribution of burglary 
counts at the neighbourhood level for all the districts in Northamptonshire. To
do this we use the `geom_density_ridges()` function from the `ggridges` package
to create a *ridge plot*. Although this function does not come from the 
`ggplot2` package, it is designed to be used inside a `ggplot()` stack.

```{r dist-exercise4, exercise=TRUE}
library(ggridges)

burglary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = str_replace_all(district, "\\s", "\n"))) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of burglaries in Ketting neighbourhoods",
    x = "count of burglaries, 2020",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The ridge plot shows the distribution of burglary counts in LSOAs within each
district, with the distributions overlapping slightly to save space. From this
we can see that across all districts most LSOAs have few burglaries, with a 
small number of LSOAs having more.

```{r include=FALSE}
burglary_district_counts <- count(burglary, district, sort = TRUE)
```


### Small-multiple charts

Density plots can be helpful to summarise a lot of information, but they have 
some disadvantages. In particular, they don't show that the number of LSOAs in
each district is quite different: there are 
`r pluck(burglary_district_counts, "n", 1)` LSOAs in 
`r pluck(burglary_district_counts, "district", 1)` but only 
`r pluck(burglary_district_counts, "n", nrow(burglary_district_counts))` LSOAs in
`r pluck(burglary_district_counts, "district", nrow(burglary_district_counts))`.
To make this clearer we can instead produce several dot plots, one for each
district -- what are called *small-multiple* charts.

We could create small-multiple charts by producing a separate dot plot for each
district and then combine them with the `patchwork` package, but that would
involve a lot of repeated code. Fortunately, we can use a feature of the 
`ggplot2` package called *faceting* to split our single dot plot into multiple
plots based on a column in the data (in this case, the district name).

Adding `facet_wrap()` to our `ggplot()` stack will cause R to create multiple
plots and wrap them across multiple rows and columns so that they approximately
fit into the available space. If we only want the small multiples to appear on
top of each other (i.e. in multiple rows) or next to each other (i.e. in 
multiple columns), we can use the `facet_grid()` function. In this case we want
the small multiples to appear on top of each other, so we will use 
`facet_grid()` and say that the small multiples (which `ggplot2` calls *facets*)
should be based on the `district` column in the data by specifying 
`rows = vars(district)` (don't worry about why the `vars()` function is 
necessary).


```{r dist-exercise5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=20, fig.asp=1}
burglary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, colour = district, fill = district)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "grey80") +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1, dotsize = 0.7) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(district), labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 10)) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of burglaries in Northamptonshire neighbourhoods",
    subtitle = "each dot represents one LSOA",
    x = "count of burglaries, 2020",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none",
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0)
  )
```

You might have noticed we made some other changes to our code for this chart to 
make it clearer:

  * Set the dot `colour` and `fill` to be based on the `district` column in the
    data, so the dots in each small multiple will be a different colour. We then 
    remove the legend that is automatically generated by adding the `colour` and 
    `fill` aesthetics using the `legend.position = "none"` attribute to 
    `theme()`, since the legend is redundant (the same information is shown in 
    the facet labels).
  * Made the dots slightly smaller with `dotsize = 0.7` because there are so 
    many LSOAs in Northampton that otherwise some of the stacks would be too
    tall to fit on the plot.
  * Removed the values and the title on the *y* axis, since it is clear from the
    rest of the chart that the vertical axis shows the count of dots in each
    stack.
  * Removed the grid lines for the *y* axis by setting the `theme()` attributes
    `panel.grid.major.y` and `panel.grid.minor.y` to be `element_blank()`.
  * Added a horizontal line at zero on the *y* axis using `geom_hline()` to make 
    it easier to compare the height of each stack of dots to zero.
  * Wrapped the facet labels using the `label_wrap_gen()` helper function so 
    that some of the longer district names don't take up too much space 
    horizontally.
  * Made the facet labels easier to read by making the text horizontal (rather
    than the default vertical text) using the `strip.text.y` attribute to 
    `theme()` and the `element_text()` helper function. `angle` sets the 
    rotation of the text (or in this case, specifies that there should be no
    rotation) and `hjust = 0` specifies that the text should be left aligned.

If you want to play around with each of these parts of the code to understand
what they do in more detail, remove one part at a time and re-run the code to
see how the appearance of the plot changes.

There are many more-technical ways to show distributions, such as box plots or
violin plots. However, these can be difficult to interpret for people who are
not used to looking at those particular types of chart, so they should probably
be avoided for communicating with general audiences.



## Comparing continuous variables

So far we have used bar charts to communicate a single number (in our example,
a number of murders) for each value of a categorical variable (the name of each 
Malaysian state or territory), and dot plots to show multiple numbers (burglary
counts for each neighbourhood) for each value of a categorical variable 
(districts in Northamptonshire). 

Both these types of chart compare a numeric variable to a categorical one. But
sometimes we may want to compare two categorical variables. We can do this with
a *scatter plot*. For example, the object `vehicle_theft` contains rates of 
thefts of and from motor vehicles per 100,000 households saying they own a 
vehicle for a selection of `r nrow(vehicle_theft)` municipalities in South 
Africa. Since thefts *of* vehicle and thefts *from* vehicles are different but 
related crimes, we might want to see if there is a relationship between counts 
of each type.

```{r}
head(vehicle_theft)
```

To create a `ggplot()` scatter plot we use `geom_point()`, the same function we
previously used to create point maps. This makes sense, since point maps are a
specialised type of scatter plot in which the *x* and *y* axes of the chart show
the latitude and longitude or easting and northing of each crime location.

```{r scatter-exercise1, exercise=TRUE, fig.asp=1}
ggplot(
  vehicle_theft, 
  aes(x = theft_of_motor_vehicle, y = theft_from_motor_vehicle)
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Vehicle thefts in South African municipalities",
    subtitle = "each dot represents one municipality, 2018-19",
    x = "rate of thefts of motor vehicles per 100,000 vehicle-owning households",
    y = "rate of thefts from motor vehicles per 100,000 vehicle-owning households"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

From this plot we can see that most areas have low rates of both theft of and
theft from motor vehicles, with a few areas having very-high rates of one type
or the other (but none have high rates of both).

Looking at the bottom-left corner of the chart we can see that we have again
encountered the problem of overlapping points making patterns less clear. We can
try to deal with this by making the points semi-transparent using the `alpha`
argument to `geom_point()`.

Scatter plots can be hard for people to interpret, especially if they are not 
used to interpreting charts. To help readers, we can annotate the plot to show
how to interpret each region of the chart. We will add two types of annotation:

  1. Lines to show the median value on each axis, i.e. the mid-point value that 
     is larger than 50% of values and smaller than the other 50%.
  2. Labels to help readers interpret the different parts of the plot.

We can add median lines using the `geom_hline()` and `geom_vline()` functions,
which add horizontal and vertical lines to plots. We will add these to the
`ggplot()` stack *before* `geom_point()` so that the lines appear *behind* the
points.

To add text annotations we use the `annotate()` function from `ggplot2`, which
allows us to add data to a chart by specifying the aesthetics (*x* and *y*
position, etc.) directly rather than by referencing columns in the data. To add
a text annotation, we set the `geom` argument of `annotate()` to `"text"`.

```{r scatter-exercise3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=46, fig.asp=1}
ggplot(
  vehicle_theft, 
  aes(x = theft_of_motor_vehicle, y = theft_from_motor_vehicle)
) +
  geom_vline(
    # On the next line of code we use the `pull()` function to extract the 
    # values in the `theft_of_motor_vehicle` column and then the `median()`
    # function to find the median value
    xintercept = median(pull(vehicle_theft, "theft_of_motor_vehicle")),
    linetype = "22"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = median(pull(vehicle_theft, "theft_from_motor_vehicle")),
    linetype = "22"
  ) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  annotate(
    # We specify `geom = "text"` because we want to annotate the chart with some
    # text -- we could also have annotated the plot with a point, a line, etc.
    geom = "text", 
    # The values of `x` and `y` have been chosen manually based on looking at 
    # the chart above
    x = 1500, 
    y = 10, 
    label = "high rate of thefts of vehicles\nlow rate of thefts from vehicles", 
    hjust = 1,
    lineheight = 1
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "text", 
    x = 10, 
    y = 6500, 
    label = "low rate of thefts of vehicles\nhigh rate of thefts from vehicles", 
    hjust = 0,
    lineheight = 1
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Vehicle thefts in South African municipalities",
    subtitle = str_glue(
      "each dot represents one municipality, 2018-19, dashed lines show ",
      "median values"
    ),
    x = "rate of thefts of motor vehicles per 100,000 vehicle-owning households",
    y = "rate of thefts from motor vehicles per 100,000 vehicle-owning households"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

From this plot we can now see that half of municipalities have very low rates of 
both types of theft (shown by the number of dots below and to the left of the 
median lines).

We can make some further changes to this chart. For example, instead of 
labelling areas on the plot we could instead label the municipalities with high
rates of vehicle theft (we cannot include both types of label because they would
overlap). To do that, we will create a new column in the data containing either
the municipality name (for high-rate municipalities) or `NA` (meaning `ggplot()`
will not create a label for that row if we set `na.rm = TRUE`). We can then use 
the `geom_label_repel()` function from the `ggrepel` package (which is designed
to extend what you can do with the `ggplot2` package) to add the labels to the 
chart. We will also remember to add `label = label` to the `aes()` function so 
`ggplot()` knows which column in the data to use for the labels.

```{r scatter-exercise4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=36, fig.asp=1}
library(ggrepel)

vehicle_theft %>% 
  mutate(
    # This code creates a new column called `label` that either contains the 
    # name of the municipality (for extreme values) or the missing value `NA`
    # (for all the municipalities without extreme values)
    label = ifelse(
      theft_of_motor_vehicle > 500 | theft_from_motor_vehicle > 2200, 
      municipality, 
      NA
    )
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = theft_of_motor_vehicle, y = theft_from_motor_vehicle, label = label)
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = median(pull(vehicle_theft, "theft_of_motor_vehicle")),
    linetype = "22"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = median(pull(vehicle_theft, "theft_from_motor_vehicle")),
    linetype = "22"
  ) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_label_repel(na.rm = TRUE, label.size = 0, lineheight = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Vehicle thefts in South African municipalities",
    subtitle = str_glue(
      "each dot represents one municipality, 2018-19, dashed lines show ",
      "median values"
    ),
    x = "rate of thefts of motor vehicles per 100,000 vehicle-owning households",
    y = "rate of thefts from motor vehicles per 100,000 vehicle-owning households"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

From this chart, we can see which municipalities have particularly unusual 
vehicle theft rates. For example, we might well want to explore the rates of
theft from vehicles in Laingsburg and Knysna municipalities to see what makes
them so different from the others, and similarly for the rate of theft of 
vehicles in Mthonjaneni.



## In summary

In this tutorial we have learned how to present data visually in R. These 
techniques give us more flexibility about how to best present data to 
communicate the main points that we want to get across.

Whether to use a map or a chart, and which type of map or chart to use, are
design decisions for you to make. When you make these decisions, always remember
that what is most important is that your audience understands your message. This
makes it very important that you understand your audience.

Visualising data with charts is a very large topic and there are lots of 
resources available to help you learn more. To get started, you might want to
look at:

  * [An Introduction to ggplot2](https://uc-r.github.io/ggplot_intro) from the
    University of Cincinnati Business Analytics team.
  * The [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
    by the team that develops the `ggplot2 package.
  * The [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com) for examples of many
    other types of chart that you can produce in R.
